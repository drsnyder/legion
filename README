# Legion

Simple tool for running a procedure N times in T threads (using pmap). The motivation for this was
quick and easy testing / tinkering with different locking / concurrency features in
postgresql. I could also see this being used as a simple load tester for a web site,
database, or server.

# Quickstart

	# run the test procedure 100 times (serially) in 2 threads (concurrently)
	lein run -c test -t 2 -n 100 -f legionfile

To create a new procedure, just add it to the legion file and run it with -c. For help
text:

	lein run -h
